## What this is

A statically-generated site built with **Astro 4.16**. Pages are authored as
`.astro` components and compiled to plain HTML/CSS at build time — fast to load,
easy to version, no client-side framework. A little inline JS handles the nav
toggle and scroll reveals. The build is produced by GitHub Actions and published
to GitHub Pages behind Cloudflare.

> Migrated from a hand-maintained static HTML site in June 2026. See
> `CUTOVER.md` (historical record — do not execute).

## SEO & structured data

The `<head>` is defined once in `src/components/Seo.astro`, used by both
`BaseLayout` and `ArticleLayout`, so meta, Open Graph, fonts, GA4, and JSON-LD
never drift across pages. Pages pass a full `title` and `description`; utility
pages can pass `noindex`, and any page can pass page-specific `schema`.

**Structured data emitted:**

- **`ProfessionalService`** — sitewide, from `Seo.astro` (logo, founder, address, LinkedIn in `sameAs`, `knowsAbout`, `priceRange`, slogan).
- **`BreadcrumbList`** — sitewide, *derived from the URL path* against `nav.ts`, so the trail can't drift from the IA.
- **`Service`** — on the Assessment page (`$5,000–$9,500` range), via the `schema` prop.
- **`OfferCatalog`** — on the Services page, listing the four paid offers and their ranges.
- **`Article`** — on every article, from `ArticleLayout`.
- **`FAQPage`** — on the Assessment page.

> Not yet emitted: `Review` / `AggregateRating`. Deferred until the real,
> anonymized client testimonials are finalized — review schema on in-flux data is
> a quality risk, not a win.

**Crawlability:** `/thanks` and `/404` carry `noindex, follow`. The custom sitemap
generator in `astro.config.mjs` reads the built page list and writes `sitemap.xml`,
excluding `404` and any `noindex` utility pages. (We don't use `@astrojs/sitemap` —
its `build:done` hook in v3.7.3 crashes against Astro 4.16.)

## Content pillars

Articles in the Insights hub are organized into five pillars (defined in
`src/data/insights.ts`):

1. **Reporting Trust** — why dashboards lose trust and how to rebuild it
2. **KPI Definitions** — metric ownership, dictionaries, conflict resolution
3. **Dashboard Modernization** — design, perception, what belongs on a dashboard
4. **Governance & Strategy** — practical governance, data strategy
5. **AI Readiness** — why trusted metrics precede AI

Plus **Field Studies** — original data analysis (wage inequality, productivity–pay
gap, corporate profits & inflation). Field studies cite primary sources (BEA, EPI, SSA).

---

## Conventions

- **Headers** use Newsreader; body/UI uses DM Sans; Abril Fatface is reserved for article display titles, standout statistics, and decorative marks only.
- **The owl** is the logo. Do not reintroduce the æ ligature as a logo substitute (it's fine as a faint decorative background mark).
- **Pricing** must match the Operating Brief offer ladder. Flagship Assessment: `$5,000–$9,500` standard (reduced for nonprofit/referral/small-scope). Keep schema price ranges in sync with on-page prices.
- **No fabricated** testimonials, metrics, logos, or client results — ever. Case studies are anonymized.
- **Even-handed** on contested economic/political topics in field studies.

## Analytics & privacy

GA4 (`G-4TVCCT0XW9`) loads sitewide from `Seo.astro`. A plain-language privacy
disclosure lives at `/privacy` and is linked from every footer.

---

## Building & deploying

```bash
npm install        # first time
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run check      # repo invariant checks only (scripts/check.mjs)
npm run build      # invariant checks + production build → dist/ (+ sitemap.xml)
```

A build that fails with `INVARIANT FAILURE` was stopped by `scripts/check.mjs`
— the rules it enforces are documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

To deploy: commit to a feature branch, merge to `main` (`--no-ff`), and push.
GitHub Actions builds the Astro site and publishes to GitHub Pages within a minute
or two. Verify live against the apex domain with a cache-buster (Cloudflare caches
HTML):

```bash
curl -sL "https://aesopanalytics.com/?v=$RANDOM" | grep -i "<title>"
```

## Project status

- **Infrastructure (GTM Sprint 0) — complete.** GA4, Search Console + Bing, SPF/DKIM/DMARC via SendGrid, Cloudflare security headers (A), custom sitemap, robots.txt, custom 404, `/privacy`, `/diagnostic` (Cal.com), Formspree contact → `/thanks`.
- **SEO Foundation (GTM Sprint 1) — complete.** Keyword map; keyword-tuned metadata across all pages; `ProfessionalService` + `BreadcrumbList` + `Service` + `OfferCatalog` structured data; `noindex` on utility pages; sitemap synced to noindex.
- **Next:**
  - **Testimonials & case-study refresh** — surface real (anonymized) client work, then add `Review`/`AggregateRating` schema.
  - **Google Business Profile** — Nashville, NAP-consistent.
  - Later GTM sprints per the roadmap.

> **Sprint numbering note:** commit-message "Sprint N" labels are dev-sprint
> numbers and do not map 1:1 to the GTM-roadmap sprint numbers above.
